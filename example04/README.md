# Example 04

In this example we will use EcmaScript2016 and a transpiler to stay compliant with older browsers.

We will use `gulp` as build tool.

## Setup and usage

```bash
npm install
```

- All javascript modules are located in folder `src/js/modules`.
- For simplicity, we'll use the npm package `http-server` to run the site:
Install `http-server`:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Run `http-server` from the command line and visit [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html).
